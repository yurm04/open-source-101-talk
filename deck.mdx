<FullImage src={chroniclerGithub} />

<Notes>

- A  few years ago, I built a tool called Chronicler that I wanted to open source.
- Like many of you here today, I had no idea what I was doing when it came to publishing my own open source project on my own.

</Notes>


---


<FullImage src={chroniclerGithub} />

<Notes>

- Yes, I had used plenty of open source projects at that point in my career. But I had never been the one to bear my heart and soul on the internet, and publicly put my work out there.
- so, I did what anyone would have doneâ€¦

</Notes>


---


<FullImage src={google} />

<Notes>

- ...I googled my way out of it. And I put together a lot of disparate pieces for how I could successfully put my project out into the world.
- And after I finally got it all together and pushed it all up to GitHub...

</Notes>


---


<FullImage src={catTyping} />

<Notes>

- ...I decided to write about my experience open sourcing my first project.

</Notes>


---


<FullImage src={chronicler} />

<Notes>

- And I came out with my blog post titled  `how to take your open source project from good to great.
- It was a beginnerâ€™s guide for how you could create a great open source project. All based on my research, conversations with colleagues and friends, and my experience at the time.

</Notes>


---


<img src={chroniclerDate} />

<Notes>

- that was published back in 2019, and looking back on it now on march 30, 2021 that was approximately 1000 years ago.
- And truthfully a lot of what I wrote in that post still holds up, so I encourage you to go read it.
- The general take away of my blog post is that there are a lot of ways that you can take your open source project from good to great. I wrote about a few that I thought were important, and today Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll learn plenty more of them in other sessions later on.

</Notes>

<Layout layout={layouts.sectionTitle} theme={themes.dark}>

## Today

</Layout>

<Notes>

- But today I want to focus on something that was missing from that blog post I wrote. Something that Iâ€™ve been learning more and more of over these last few years of my career, that I somehow always come back to as one of the most important aspects of the work that I do.
- one of the most impactful ways you can take your open source projects from good to great...

</Notes>

<Layout layout={layouts.sectionTitle} theme={themes.light}>

# Community

</Layout>

<Notes>

- ...is to focus on community
-  Community is the heart of open source. 
- Itâ€™s what drives us to volunteer our time and energy to projects that can be used by thousands more. 
- It prompts us to become better teachers, and enables us always to constantly learn new things. 

</Notes>


---


<Layout layout={layouts.sectionTitle} theme={themes.light}>

# Community

</Layout>

<Notes>

- it's what brings us all here together today...
- Without a strong sense of community, there would be no Open Source 101 conference. 
- Without the thousands of communities out there today, there would be no open source at all.
- Just like I said in my original blog post, there are a lot of ways you can focus on community while youâ€™re open sourcing your work
- Today, Iâ€™m going to focus on just a few quick, tactical tips Iâ€™ve picked up along the way.


</Notes>

<Layout layout={layouts.sectionTitle} theme={themes.light}>

# Be Welcoming

</Layout>

<Notes>

- first impressions can be long-lasting, so do all you can to make folks feel welcome when they first discover your project.


</Notes>


---


<Layout showWebsite={true} layout="introLayout">

## `README.md`

</Layout>

<Notes>

- One of the best places to do this might be your `README.md` file.
- it's the first page you're users will see, and usually houses a ton on important information.
- So addressing your users and contributors in your `README.md` file is a small step that goes a long way in creating a sense of belonging. 


</Notes>


---


<Layout showWebsite={true} layout="introLayout">

## `README.md`

</Layout>

<Notes>

- you can add your motivation for the projectin your README, describe who it serves, and any values or principles that help guide you as you work.
- this can give your community something to come together on, and helps motivate everyone to make progress together.


</Notes>


---


<Layout showWebsite={true} layout="introLayout">

## `README.md`

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Your readme is also a great place to show gratitude.
- You can thank newcomers for coming to visit in the first place, and show some love to the different contributors that help make your project everything that it is. 

</Notes>


---


<Layout showWebsite={true} layout="introLayout">

## `all-contributors`

</Layout>

<Notes>

-  the `all-contributors` spec and supporting tools makes it super easy to celebrate all kinds of contributors for their help, beyond just engineering support.
- it includes recognition for documentation writing, bug filing, translation, design help, and lots of other contribution types.


</Notes>


---


<Layout showWebsite={true} layout="introLayout">

## `AUTHORS.md`

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Or, you could add and authors.md file to your project.


</Notes>


---


<FullImage src={sinatra} />

<Notes>

- The open source project Sinatra has a great example of this in their `AUTHORS.md` file
- they personally and specifically thank many of of the project's main contributors.


</Notes>


---


<Layout layout={layouts.sectionTitle} theme={themes.light}>

# Be Inclusive

</Layout>

<Notes>

- For your open source project to have a great community, you must also be Inclusive
- emphasize the importance of kindness and multual respect in all aspects of what community members do. And again, put that in your README.md or somewhere equally prominent.

</Notes>


---


<Layout layout={layouts.sectionTitle} theme={themes.light}>

# Code Review

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Be specific about how best to give feedback in Code Review or how to keep discussions cordial and productive.

</Notes>


---


<Layout layout={layouts.sectionTitle} theme={themes.light}>

# Build a healthy culture

</Layout>

<Notes>

- and try to be as intentional and thoughtful about the culture you're trying to build.
- good culture doesn't happen by accident. You need to cultivate it and nurture it into what you all want it to be.

</Notes>


---


<Layout showWebsite={true} layout="introLayout">

## Code of Conduct

</Layout>

<Notes>

- a code of conduct helps to reinforce that culture.
- and is one small part of creating a space that is safe and welcoming for all people
- will make it very clear what kind of behavior is not tolerated when participating in your community
 

</Notes>


---


<FullImage src={codeCovenant} />

<Notes>

- The contributor covenant is a well-respected and frequently adopted code of conduct that you can make your own.
 

</Notes>


---


<FullImage src={openSource101CC} />

<Notes>

- Or you can pull inspiration from existing organizations and their code of conduct, like the one Open Source 101 has.
 

</Notes>


---


<Layout showWebsite={true} layout="introLayout">

## Celebrate the people

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Recognize and celbrate the fact that your community is made up of people from all walks of life. 
- different backgrounds, experience levels, race, ethnicities, religions, and nationalities. All coming together to work on a project that means something to you all, and binds you all together.

</Notes>


---


<Layout showWebsite={true} layout="introLayout">

## Welcome and amplify different voices

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Having a diverse community doesn't come for free or by accident.
- And its no secret that the tech and open source fields have been particularly toxic for folks belonging to minority and marginalized groups.
- Put the work in to make your community one that is safe and welcoming for everyone, especially those that have been historically left out.

</Notes>


---


<Layout showWebsite={true} layout="introLayout">

## Diversity and Inclusion

</Layout>

<Notes>

- I want to add a quick note here because I think it's so important to get this point accross.
- diversity and inclusion in open source communities is a huge topic in and of itself, one that demands and deserves thoughtful and intentional effort.
- I add it here quickly, not to mislead you into thinking it is a quick tip to add to your check list, but to underscore the importance of it and urge you to give it the time and focus it needs.

</Notes>


---


<Layout showWebsite={true} layout="introLayout">

## Help others learn

</Layout>

<Notes>

- No matter what your experience level, brand new to programming or years of experience under your belt...
- everyone is going to need a little extra help at some point.
- Optimize how your users and contributors can get up and running, and feeling confident 

</Notes>


---

<Layout showWebsite={true} layout="introLayout">

## Encourage discussion

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Set up channels of communication where people can come together to ask questions and learn from each other



</Notes>


---

<Layout showWebsite={true} layout="introLayout">

## Slack, Discord, and IRC

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Slack discord and IRC channels are perfect for these kinds of asynchronous conversations.


</Notes>


---

<Layout showWebsite={true} layout="introLayout">

## "IRL" conversations

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Also consider video or conference calls to bring community members together.
- These can be open office hours to ask questions, meetups to learn new topics, or just time to discuss the future of the project together.
- It's an incredibly personal experience that helps build a human connection to your project and goes way beyond the code.


</Notes>


---


<Layout showWebsite={true} layout="introLayout">

## Help Others Contribute

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Make it super easy for folks to participate in your community, and encourage them to do so!


</Notes>


---


<Layout showWebsite={true} layout="introLayout">

## `CONTRIBUTING.md`

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Make sure you have a contributing doc to tell folks how they can get started, where they can jump in, and how they can reach out for help.


</Notes>


---


<Layout showWebsite={true} layout="introLayout">

## Mentorship

</Layout>

<Notes>

- again, a personal touch can go a long way.
- pairing closely with contributors and help them fix bugs or take on bigger projects can help build up a lot of confidence in a short amount of time.


</Notes>


---


<Layout showWebsite={true} layout="introLayout">

## Invite new maintainers

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Lastly, it takes a village to keep up a great open source project, especially one with a vibrant community.
- Find ways to bring more people into the fold.
- This could be by inviting frequent contributors to join you as maintainers and mentoring them to take on more and more responsibilities.


</Notes>

<Layout showWebsite={true} layout="introLayout">

## How to take your open source project from good to great

</Layout>

<Notes>

- As I said at the top of this talk, there are a ton of ways to take your open source project from good to great.
- Focusing on community is just one of them, but I think it's one of the most important and valuable ones that you can spend your time on.


</Notes>


---


<Layout showWebsite={true} layout="introLayout">

## How to take your open source project from good to great

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Building a community comes in many forms.
- Ultimately, it comes down to keeping people at the center of your work.
- Whether you're writing documentation, hosting meetups, building up processes around code review, or setting up continuous integration pipelines: think about how best to serve the people in your community.
- and you'll almost certainly take your open source project from good to great.


</Notes>
