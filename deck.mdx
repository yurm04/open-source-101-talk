<FullImage src={chroniclerGithub} />

<Notes>

- A  few years ago, I built a tool called Chronicler that I wanted to open source.
- Like many of you here today, I had no idea what I was doing when it came to publishing my own open source project on my own.

</Notes>


---


<FullImage src={chroniclerGithub} />

<Notes>

- Yes, I had used plenty of open source projects at that point in my career. But I had never been the one to bear my heart and soul on the internet, and publicly put my work out there.
- so, I did what anyone would have doneâ€¦

</Notes>


---


<FullImage src={google} />

<Notes>

- ...I googled my way out of it. And I put together a lot of disparate pieces for how I could successfully put my project out into the world.
- And after I finally got it all together and pushed it all up to GitHub...

</Notes>


---


<FullImage src={catTyping} />

<Notes>

- ...I decided to write about my experience open sourcing my first project.

</Notes>


---


<FullImage src={chronicler} />

<Notes>

- And I came out with my blog post titled  `how to take your open source project from good to great.
- It was a beginnerâ€™s guide for how you could create a great open source project. All based on my research, conversations with colleagues and friends, and my experience at the time.

</Notes>


---


<img src={chroniclerDate} />

<Notes>

- that was published back in 2019, and looking back on it now on march 30, 2021 that was approximately 1000 years ago.
- And truthfully a lot of what I wrote in that post still holds up, so I encourage you to go read it.
- The general take away of my blog post is that there are a lot of ways that you can take your open source project from good to great. I wrote about a few that I thought were important, and today Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll learn plenty more of them in other sessions later on.

</Notes>


---


<Layout layout={layouts.sectionTitle} theme={themes.dark}>

## Today

</Layout>

<Notes>

- But today I want to focus on something that was missing from that blog post I wrote. Something that Iâ€™ve been learning more and more of over these last few years of my career, that I somehow always come back to as one of the most important aspects of the work that I do.
- one of the most impactful ways you can take your open source projects from good to great...

</Notes>


---


<Layout layout={layouts.sectionTitle} theme={themes.light}>

# Community

</Layout>

<Notes>

- ...is to focus on community
-  Community is the heart of open source. 
- Itâ€™s what drives us to volunteer our time and energy to projects that can be used by thousands more. 
- It prompts us to become better teachers, and enables us always to constantly learn new things. 

</Notes>


---


<Layout layout={layouts.sectionTitle} theme={themes.light}>

# Community

</Layout>

<Notes>

- it's what brings us all here together today...
- Without a strong sense of community, there would be no Open Source 101 conference. 
- Without the thousands of communities out there today, there would be no open source at all.
- Just like I said in my original blog post, there are a lot of ways you can focus on community while youâ€™re open sourcing your work


</Notes>

<Layout layout={layouts.sectionTitle}>

<List>
  <li>Be Welcoming</li>
  <li>Be Inclusive</li>
  <li>Help Others Learn</li>
  <li>Help Others Contribute</li>
</List>

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Today, Iâ€™m going to focus on just a few quick, tactical tips Iâ€™ve picked up along the way.
- [GO THROUGH THE LIST]
- These are just the four cornerstones i'm going to focus on today to get you thinking about community in your open source project.
- But there are a few other sessions later on that focus more deeply on community building, so I highly encourage you to check those out.


</Notes>


---


<Layout layout={layouts.sectionTitle} theme={themes.light}>

# Be Welcoming

</Layout>

<Notes>

- to start off, we want our community to be open and welcoming. This will make newcomers feel at home and contributors coming back to keep helping.
- first impressions can be long-lasting, so do all you can to make folks feel welcome when they first discover your project.


</Notes>


---


<Layout showWebsite={true} layout={layouts.introLayout}>

## `README.md`

</Layout>

<Notes>

- One of the best places to do this might be your `README.md` file.
- it's the first page you're users will see, and usually houses a ton on important information.
- So addressing your users and contributors in your `README.md` file is a small step that goes a long way in creating a sense of belonging. 


</Notes>


---


<Layout showWebsite={true} layout={layouts.introLayout}>

## `README.md`

</Layout>

<Notes>

- you can add your motivation for the project in your README, describe who it serves, and any values or principles that help guide you as you work.
- this can give your community something to come together on, and helps motivate everyone to make progress together.


</Notes>


---


<Layout showWebsite={true} layout={layouts.introLayout}>

## `README.md`

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Your readme is also a great place to express gratitude.
- You can thank newcomers for coming to visit in the first place, and show some love to the different contributors that help make your project everything that it is. 

</Notes>


---


<FullImage src={allContributors} />

<Notes>

-  the `all-contributors` spec and supporting tools makes it super easy to celebrate all kinds of contributors for their help, beyond just engineering support.
- it includes recognition for documentation writing, bug filing, translation, design help, and lots of other contribution types.


</Notes>


---


<Layout showWebsite={true} layout={layouts.introLayout}>

## `AUTHORS.md`

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Or, you could add and authors.md file to your project.


</Notes>


---


<FullImage src={sinatra} />

<Notes>

- The open source project Sinatra has a great example of this in their `AUTHORS.md` file
- they personally and specifically thank many of of the project's main contributors.
- if your project is small enough, you can definitely find ways to personally thank contributors. But even as it grows, don't forget to give thanks to the folks that help keep your project and community going.


</Notes>


---


<Layout layout={layouts.sectionTitle}>

<List appear={false}>
  <li style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Be Welcoming</li>
  <li>Be Inclusive</li>
  <li>Help Others Learn</li>
  <li>Help Others Contribute</li>
</List>

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Making people feel welcome and valued is a key part to a strong sense of community.
- There are simple ways to accomplish this, like the ones I shared here, but don't be afraid to put your own spin on a welcoming committee that's right for your project.


</Notes>


---


<Layout layout={layouts.sectionTitle} theme={themes.light}>

# Be Inclusive

</Layout>

<Notes>

- The next pillar of a great community is inclusivity
- For your open source project to have a great community, you must also be Inclusive
- emphasize the importance of kindness and multual respect in all aspects of what community members do. And again, put that in your README.md or somewhere equally prominent.

</Notes>


---


<Layout layout={layouts.introLayout} theme={themes.dark}>

## Build a healthy culture

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Be as intentional and thoughtful about the culture you're trying to build.
- good culture doesn't happen by accident. You need to cultivate it and nurture it into what you all want it to be.

</Notes>


---


<Layout layout={layouts.introLayout} theme={themes.dark}>

## Code Review

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Be specific about how best to give feedback in Code Review or how to keep discussions cordial and productive.

</Notes>


---

<Layout showWebsite={true} layout={layouts.introLayout}>

## Code of Conduct

</Layout>

<Notes>

- a code of conduct helps to reinforce the culture you're trying to build.
- and is one small part of creating a space that is safe and welcoming for all people
- will make it very clear what kind of behavior is not tolerated when participating in your community
 

</Notes>


---


<FullImage src={codeCovenant} />

<Notes>

- The contributor covenant is a well-respected and frequently adopted code of conduct that you can make your own.
 

</Notes>


---


<FullImage src={openSource101CC} />

<Notes>

- Or you can pull inspiration from existing organizations and their code of conduct, like the one Open Source 101 has.
 

</Notes>


---


<Layout showWebsite={true} layout={layouts.introLayout}>

## Celebrate the people

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Recognize and celbrate the fact that your community is made up of people from all walks of life. 
- it's better for it, it's stronger for it.
- different backgrounds, experience levels, race, ethnicities, religions, and nationalities. All coming together to work on a project that means something to you all, and binds you all together.

</Notes>


---


<Layout showWebsite={true} layout={layouts.introLayout}>

## Welcome and amplify different voices

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Having a diverse community doesn't come for free or by accident.
- And its no secret that the tech and open source fields have been particularly toxic for folks belonging to minority and marginalized groups.
- Put the work in to make your community one that is safe and welcoming for everyone, especially those that have been historically left out.

</Notes>


---


<Layout showWebsite={true} layout={layouts.introLayout}>

## Diversity and Inclusion

</Layout>

<Notes>

- I want to add a quick note here because I think it's so important to get this point accross.
- diversity and inclusion in open source communities is a huge topic in and of itself, one that demands and deserves thoughtful and intentional effort.
- I add it here quickly, not to mislead you into thinking it is a quick tip to add to your check list, but to underscore the importance of it and urge you to give it the time and focus it needs.

</Notes>


---


<Layout layout={layouts.sectionTitle}>

<List appear={false}>
  <li>Be Welcoming</li>
  <li style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Be Inclusive</li>
  <li>Help Others Learn</li>
  <li>Help Others Contribute</li>
</List>

</Layout>

<Notes>

- A sense of belonging in your community can distinguish you from the many other projects a user or contributor can spend their time on.
- Take this to heart, and commit to making your community experiences feel open, safe, and supportive.


</Notes>


---


<Layout layout={layouts.sectionTitle} theme={themes.light}>

# Help others learn

</Layout>

<Notes>

- No matter what your experience level, brand new to programming or years of experience under your belt...
- everyone is going to need a little extra help at some point.
- having a supportive learning environment will attract folks from all different levels, and enable them to grow along with your project.

</Notes>


---

<Layout showWebsite={true} layout={layouts.introLayout}>

## Docs, docs, docs

</Layout>

<Notes>

- documentation can make or break your project, so take extra care to write documentation that is accesible, understandable, and easy to discover.
- besides your README and static documentation sites, consider creating tutorials, walkthroughs and examples that will really help people learn deeply and quickly.
- Remember, there is a person at the other end of your documentation. Help them succeed in learning by keeping your docs up to date and helpful.



</Notes>


---

<Layout showWebsite={true} layout={layouts.introLayout}>

## Encourage discussion

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Set up channels of communication where people can come together to ask questions and learn from each other



</Notes>


---

<Layout showWebsite={true} layout={layouts.introLayout}>

## Slack, Discord, and IRC

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Slack discord and IRC channels are perfect for these kinds of asynchronous conversations.


</Notes>


---

<Layout showWebsite={true} layout={layouts.introLayout}>

## "IRL" conversations

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Also consider video or conference calls to bring community members together.
- These can be open office hours to ask questions, meetups to learn new topics, or just time to discuss the future of the project together.



</Notes>


---

<img src={chroniclerMeetup} />

<Notes>

- this is me back in 2018 when I first published chronicler, speaking at a meetup that NYT.
- I shared my chronicler with the group, explained how they could help by contributing code to the project, and encouraged them to reach out online or in person if they needed any help at all.
- Taking a personal approach helps build a human connection to your project and goes way beyond the code.

</Notes>


---


<Layout layout={layouts.sectionTitle}>

<List appear={false}>
  <li>Be Welcoming</li>
  <li>Be Inclusive</li>
  <li style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Help Others Learn</li>
  <li>Help Others Contribute</li>
</List>

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Building a culture of teaching and learning in your community helps bring people together and creates strong, human connections.
- There's plenty you can do to help your users and contributors become fluent in your particular project, so always be on the lookout for how you can enable your community to do their best work.


</Notes>


---


<Layout showWebsite={true} layout={layouts.sectionTitle} theme={themes.light}>

# Help Others Contribute

</Layout>

<Notes>

- The last pillar of your great community should be to help others contribute
- Make it super easy for folks to participate in your community, and encourage them to do so!


</Notes>


---


<Layout showWebsite={true} layout={layouts.introLayout}>

## `CONTRIBUTING.md`

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Make sure you have a contributing doc to tell folks how they can get started, where they can jump in, and how they can reach out for help.


</Notes>


---


<Layout showWebsite={true} layout={layouts.introLayout}>

## Good first issue

</Layout>

<Notes>

- It can be intimidating for a newcomer to land on a project their excited to participate in and have no idea where to start.
- Make a habit of labeling different issues based on how difficult they might be to tackle, and make it especially clear when a task would be suited best for beginners.

</Notes>


---


<FullImage src={firstIssue} />

<Notes>

- you'll see here that the react codebase has a label for all open issues that are approachable enough for beginners to take on.
- this encourages new contributors to submit their own work and helps to grow your community ranks

</Notes>


---


<Layout showWebsite={true} layout={layouts.introLayout}>

## Mentorship

</Layout>

<Notes>

- again, a personal touch can go a long way.
- pairing closely with contributors and help them fix bugs or take on bigger projects can help build up a lot of confidence in a short amount of time.


</Notes>


---


<Layout showWebsite={true} layout={layouts.introLayout}>

## Invite new maintainers

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Lastly, it takes a village to keep up a great open source project, especially one with a vibrant community.
- Find ways to bring more people into the fold.
- This could be by inviting frequent contributors to join you as maintainers and mentoring them to take on more and more responsibilities.


</Notes>


---


<Layout layout={layouts.sectionTitle}>

<List appear={false}>
  <li>Be Welcoming</li>
  <li>Be Inclusive</li>
  <li>Help Others Learn</li>
  <li style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Help Others Contribute</li>
</List>

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Maintaining your open source project won't be easy, and it'll be particularly hard at first when you're on your own.
- the faster you can get folks to contribute, the easier it will be to share the responsibility of maintaining a great project.


</Notes>

<h1 style={{textAlign: 'left'}}>How to take your Open Source Project from Good to Great</h1>

</Layout>

<Notes>

- As I said at the top of this talk, there are a ton of ways to take your open source project from good to great.
- Focusing on community is just one of them, but I think it's one of the most important and valuable ones that you can spend your time on.


</Notes>


---


<Layout layout={layouts.sectionTitle}>

<h1 style={{textAlign: 'left'}}>How to take your Open Source Project from Good to Great</h1>

</Layout>

<Notes>

- Ultimately, building a great community, it comes down to keeping people at the center of your work.
- Whether you're writing documentation, hosting meetups, building up processes around code review, or setting up continuous integration pipelines: think about how best to serve the people in your community.
- and you'll almost certainly take your open source project from good to great.


</Notes>
